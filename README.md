simple-rtmp-server
==================

simple rtmp origin live server over state-threads.<br/>
can be used as origin server, or rtmp-server for encoder.

1. simple: also stable enough.
2. high-performance: single-thread, async socket, event/st-thread driven.
3. support origin only, no edge mode.
4. only for live streaming.
5. donot support vhost, \_\_defaultVhost\_\_ only.
6. single process, no multiple processes yet.
