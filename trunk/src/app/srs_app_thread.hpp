/**
* the handler for the thread, callback interface.
* the thread model defines as:
*     handler->on_enter_loop()
*     while loop:
*        handler->on_before_cycle()
*        handler->cycle()
*        handler->on_end_cycle()
*        if !loop then break for user stop thread.
*        sleep(CycleIntervalMilliseconds)
*     handler->on_leave_loop()
* when stop, the thread will interrupt the st_thread,
* which will cause the socket to return error and 
* terminate the cycle thread.
*
* when thread interrupt, the socket maybe not got EINT,
* espectially on st_usleep(), so the cycle must check the loop,
* when handler->cycle() has loop itself, for example:
*         handler->cycle() is:
*             while (true):
*                 st_usleep(0);
*                 if (read_from_socket(skt) < 0) break;
* if thread stop when read_from_socket, it's ok, the loop will break,
* but when thread stop interrupt the s_usleep(0), then the loop is
* death loop.
* in a word, the handler->cycle() must:
*        handler->cycle() is:
*             while (pthread->can_loop()):
*                st_usleep(0);
*                 if (read_from_socket(skt) < 0) break;
* check the loop, then it works.
