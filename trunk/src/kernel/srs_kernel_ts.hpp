    * false. The discontinuity indicator is used to indicate two types of discontinuities, system time-base discontinuities and
    * continuity_counter discontinuities.
    * 
    * A system time-base discontinuity is indicated by the use of the discontinuity_indicator in Transport Stream packets of a
    * PID designated as a PCR_PID (refer to 2.4.4.9). When the discontinuity state is true for a Transport Stream packet of a
    * PID designated as a PCR_PID, the next PCR in a Transport Stream packet with that same PID represents a sample of a
    * new system time clock for the associated program. The system time-base discontinuity point is defined to be the instant
    * in time when the first byte of a packet containing a PCR of a new system time-base arrives at the input of the T-STD.
    * The discontinuity_indicator shall be set to '1' in the packet in which the system time-base discontinuity occurs. The
    * discontinuity_indicator bit may also be set to '1' in Transport Stream packets of the same PCR_PID prior to the packet
    * which contains the new system time-base PCR. In this case, once the discontinuity_indicator has been set to '1', it shall
    * continue to be set to '1' in all Transport Stream packets of the same PCR_PID up to and including the Transport Stream
    * packet which contains the first PCR of the new system time-base. After the occurrence of a system time-base
    * discontinuity, no fewer than two PCRs for the new system time-base shall be received before another system time-base
    * discontinuity can occur. Further, except when trick mode status is true, data from no more than two system time-bases
    * shall be present in the set of T-STD buffers for one program at any time.
    *
    * Prior to the occurrence of a system time-base discontinuity, the first byte of a Transport Stream packet which contains a
    * PTS or DTS which refers to the new system time-base shall not arrive at the input of the T-STD. After the occurrence of
    * a system time-base discontinuity, the first byte of a Transport Stream packet which contains a PTS or DTS which refers
    * to the previous system time-base shall not arrive at the input of the T-STD.
    *
    * A continuity_counter discontinuity is indicated by the use of the discontinuity_indicator in any Transport Stream packet.
    * When the discontinuity state is true in any Transport Stream packet of a PID not designated as a PCR_PID, the
    * continuity_counter in that packet may be discontinuous with respect to the previous Transport Stream packet of the same
    * PID. When the discontinuity state is true in a Transport Stream packet of a PID that is designated as a PCR_PID, the
    * continuity_counter may only be discontinuous in the packet in which a system time-base discontinuity occurs. A
    * continuity counter discontinuity point occurs when the discontinuity state is true in a Transport Stream packet and the
    * continuity_counter in the same packet is discontinuous with respect to the previous Transport Stream packet of the same
    * PID. A continuity counter discontinuity point shall occur at most one time from the initiation of the discontinuity state
    * until the conclusion of the discontinuity state. Furthermore, for all PIDs that are not designated as PCR_PIDs, when the
    * discontinuity_indicator is set to '1' in a packet of a specific PID, the discontinuity_indicator may be set to '1' in the next
    * Transport Stream packet of that same PID, but shall not be set to '1' in three consecutive Transport Stream packet of that
    * same PID.
    *
    * For the purpose of this clause, an elementary stream access point is defined as follows:
    *       Video 每 The first byte of a video sequence header.
    *       Audio 每 The first byte of an audio frame.
    *
    * After a continuity counter discontinuity in a Transport packet which is designated as containing elementary stream data,
    * the first byte of elementary stream data in a Transport Stream packet of the same PID shall be the first byte of an
    * elementary stream access point or in the case of video, the first byte of an elementary stream access point or a
    * sequence_end_code followed by an access point. Each Transport Stream packet which contains elementary stream data
    * with a PID not designated as a PCR_PID, and in which a continuity counter discontinuity point occurs, and in which a
    * PTS or DTS occurs, shall arrive at the input of the T-STD after the system time-base discontinuity for the associated
    * program occurs. In the case where the discontinuity state is true, if two consecutive Transport Stream packets of the same
    * PID occur which have the same continuity_counter value and have adaptation_field_control values set to '01' or '11', the
    * second packet may be discarded. A Transport Stream shall not be constructed in such a way that discarding such a packet
    * will cause the loss of PES packet payload data or PSI data.
    *
    * After the occurrence of a discontinuity_indicator set to '1' in a Transport Stream packet which contains PSI information,
    * a single discontinuity in the version_number of PSI sections may occur. At the occurrence of such a discontinuity, a
    * version of the TS_program_map_sections of the appropriate program shall be sent with section_length = = 13 and the
    * current_next_indicator = = 1, such that there are no program_descriptors and no elementary streams described. This shall
    * then be followed by a version of the TS_program_map_section for each affected program with the version_number
